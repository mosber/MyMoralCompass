Compass Scorecard</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome to the Moral Compass Scorecard!</p>
<p>  This website is a prototype of a site I am developing based  on a series of articles I&rsquo;ve been working on over the past year.&nbsp; The topics are events in our history where  people have made moral choices, and we (with the benefit of hindsight) get to  give them a report card.</p>
<p>  Each topic contains a presentation of the event with my  article, my scorecard, and a number of videos, graphics and links available on  the internet.&nbsp; Some of the events are  well known, such as the civil rights movement and the Viet Nam war.&nbsp; Some are not so well known such as the  McMartin trial.&nbsp; Eventually, the site  will be interactive, allowing visitors to add their own comments, create their  own scorecards, and vote on a series of online polls relating to the events.</p>
<p>  This prototype site only contains 2 live sections &ndash; the Anti-Communist  blacklisting section and the Willie Horton Ads section.&nbsp; The design and content are still in development.<br />
