    <p>I  started by writing about subjects I wanted to write about.</p>
    <p>It  starts with the holocaust.  This is the  one event in human history that stands out.   The whole act of murdering 6 million people because they are Jewish is  the standard-bearer for despicable human behavior.</p>
    <p>We all  have a value system.  For a lot of people  it starts with the 10 commandments, or at least the ones that resonate with  everyone – thou shalt not kill, steal, bear false witness (lie!).  As Americans we also are strongly influenced  by the constitution – freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of  religion.  “We hold these truths to be  self-evident that all men are created equal.”   For modern times this is updated to “all men and women are created  equal.”  I’ll bet everyone would feel  proud if at the end of their life they could say they lived by these  values.  </p>
    <p>What  happens that gets us away from living by these values – I’m going to identify a  few motivators that have a habit of making people stray from these values.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greed – the constant drive in our lives for  money and power.</li>
      <li>Fear – the constant fear of some unknown event  we’ve been told to fear or just naturally fear on its own</li>
      <li>Ideology – we’re often motivated to follow an  ideology, such as capitalism vs. socialism, democracy vs. communism.  </li>
      <li>Follow the mob mentality – when mobs of people  are whipped up into a frenzy about something, it’s easier to follow the mob  than to stand up against it.</li>
      <li>Obedience to authority – this is a big one that  comes up again and again.  See the  Stanley Milgram experiment because it explains a lot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This in  a nutshell is the theme.  While we  profess to live by a value system, we’re all hypocrites and we live by the  values of the sins – greed, fear, ideology, follow the mob, and obey  authority.  Admit it, we all do it.  It’s only a matter of how often we fall prey  to the temptations.  I’d also contend  that most people would like to think they are altruistic and self-sacrificing,  but in reality are selfish.</p>
    <p>On the  flip side, there are countless stories of people who are strong and adhere to  the value system, overcoming their fears and their temptations to follow the  mob.  One example is the story of Denmark  1943 where the Danish people risked their lives to help thousands of  Danish Jews escape being sent to the Nazi  death camps.</p>
    <p>So this  book is a series of vignettes.  What ties  them together is how people profess a certain value system, but frequently fall  into being driven by greed, or fear, or obedience to authority.  And sometimes the opposite happens, and  people overcome the fears and often risk their lives to do something exemplary.</p>
    <p>What  also ties these vignettes together are that they’re things I wanted to write  about.  I saw the movie “Guilty By  Suspicion” and I became fascinated with the blacklisting of the 1950s.  I saw the movie “Missing” and became interested  in the 1973 coup in Chile.  I heard the  song “Hurricane” by Bob Dylan and wanted to know more about the story of  Hurricane Carter (that one may surprise you).   For each of these stories, I tried to research what really happened as  opposed to what is represented in the movie or song or in popular culture.</p>
    <p>As a  writer, I’ve tried to make this easy on you, the reader.  You don’t have to sit down and read the whole  book all at once.  Each of these 1-2 page  vignettes can be read independently.  You  can read them in order or jump around.   Just look through the table of contents and pick something that looks  interesting. </p>
