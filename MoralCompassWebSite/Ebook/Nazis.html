    <p>We begin with the Nazis.  The Nazis represent the lowest point into the  abyss humans have gone in modern history.   This was a systematic extermination of a specific group of people, the  Jews.  The concentration camps by the end  of the war were the most effective killing factories in history.  When we look at our history with slavery and  civil rights and political corruption, we know we will never go as far to the  dark side as Nazi Germany.  Driven by  Hitler, the entire German population was convinced that getting rid of the Jews  was the answer to their problems.   Meanwhile thousands of SS officers participated in systematic killing of  the Jews not because it was right, but because it was what they were told to  do.</p>
    <p>The  range of human behavior can be looked at with the story of  “Schindler’s List”.  Oskar Schindler saved the lives of 1100 Jews  by putting them to work in a factory that made defective weapons for the German  army.  What started as a money making  operation for Schindler became a mission for doing the right thing against all  odds.  On the flip side, the character  “Goth” in Schindler’s List played by Ralph Fiennes represents the most base  form of human behavior.  Empowered as an  SS lieutenant to do his part in the final solution, Goth is shown in the movie  murdering people indiscriminately with seemingly no feeling at all.  Did this character exist in the real  concentration camps?  Only those who  survived the camps would know for sure.</p>
    <p>The  holocaust represents a perfect storm of many sinful behaviors.  Hitler and his inner circle were driven by  greed and power.  They were the masterminds  of the most efficient killing machine in our time.  Countless Nazis in the Nuremberg trials used  the excuse “we were doing what we were told” which really speaks volumes about  the obedience to authority factor.  They  had to believe at some level the killing and torturing of Jews was wrong, but  did it because they were told to.  Did  some Nazi SS guards actually enjoy the abuse they were giving the Jews?  Or was it all blind obedience?  To top it off, Germans and those in other  occupied countries were taught to fear the Jews and to believe they were  responsible for the struggles in their lives.   They were all too happy to see the Jews first moved to the ghettos, then  carted off to the camps.</p>
    <p>The  holocaust in its horror also brought out wonderful deeds that some like  Schindler did at great risk to themselves.   The next story, Denmark 1943 is one of those.</p>
