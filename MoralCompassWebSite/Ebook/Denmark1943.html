<h1 align="center">Denmark, 1943</h1>
<p> This is the  story of how the people of Denmark  helped save thousands of Jews during Nazi occupation by hiding them or giving  them help in escaping to Sweden.  The events that happened in the fall of 1943  are wonderfully brought to life in the song Denmark, 1943 by singer/songwriter  Fred Small.  </p>
<p>The Germans  invaded Denmark  in 1940 and the Danish did not resist.   There were nearly 8000 Jews living in Denmark, most of them Danish  citizens.  Danes were supportive of the  Jews and considered them their friends.   Unlike other countries occupied by the Nazis, Danish Jews were spared  the indignities of being forced to be relocate to the ghettos or being forced  to wear yellow stars.  The kinship  between the Danes and the Jews would be tested severely as the Jewish new year  approached in 1943.</p>
<p><em>And it's Eichmann and Himmler are turning the screws</em><br />
    <em>The Führer they say grows impatient</em><br />
    <em>&quot;How can it be Denmark's Jews still walk free</em><br />
    <em>After three years of kind occupation?</em><br />
    <em>We will take them like sheep in their beds as they  sleep</em><br />
    <em>On the second night of their new year</em><br />
    <em>Devoutly at home they'll be helpless alone</em><br />
    <em>When they cry out no one will hear&quot;</em></p>
<p>In  September the decision was made by Hitler to round up and deport the Danish  Jews as part of The Final Solution.  On  September 28, a German diplomat Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz warned the non-Jewish  Danes of the impending deportation of Jews.   The non-Jewish Danes quickly spread the word and thus began one of the  most amazing rescue operations in history.</p>
<p><em>Christian policemen, shopkeepers, and teachers</em><br />
    <em>Tell their friends of the quickening storm</em><br />
    <em>While students on bicycles race through the streets</em><br />
    <em>Searching for Jews to be warned</em><br />
    <em>And Katlev the foreman blurts out to the trainman</em><br />
    <em>&quot;My family has no place to hide&quot;</em><br />
    <em>&quot;Well bring 'em to my house,&quot; the stranger  replies</em><br />
    <em>&quot;And we'll spit in the damn Nazi's eyes&quot;</em></p>
<p>A rescue  operation was organized immediately led by non-Jewish Danes to find hiding  places for the Jews and eventually to get them to the coast of Denmark.  From there, dozens of fisherman ferried about  7200 Jews and 700 of their non-Jewish relatives across the Øresund sea to  neutral Sweden.</p>
<p><em>Frozen with fright in the October night</em><br />
    <em>Families huddle in basements and barns</em><br />
    <em>Mistaking each breath for the angel of death</em><br />
    <em>The Gestapo, the shot, the alarm</em><br />
    <em>Then down into the hold with the stench and the cold</em><br />
    <em>And drug all the babies with schnapps</em><br />
    <em>Someone shouts, &quot;Valkömmen till Sverige</em><br />
    <em>You are in Swedish waters at last&quot;</em></p>
<p>When the  Germans began their raid on October 1 they found only a few Jews.  Most had been transported to safety in a few  short days.  Still 470 Jews were  transported to Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia.  While not a death camp it was still a  detention center, and the Danish Red Cross demanded information about the  living conditions for their fellow Danes.   The Red Cross pressured the Germans to allow inspections of  Theresienstadt and to allow care packages to be delivered to the prisoners  there.  It’s likely the Danes deterred  the Germans from transporting the Danish Jews to the death camps in Poland.  Then, when the war was over, the Danish Jews  were welcomed back to their country where their homes and businesses were still  intact, as the Danish authorities refused to allow the Germans or anyone to  steal their possessions or destroy their homes.  </p>
<p><em>Seven thousands of Jews smuggled over to Sweden</em><br />
  <em>By fishermen, nurses, and priests</em><br />
  <em>Hitler sends Eichmann to hunt them down</em><br />
  <em>But his quarry have vanished like mist</em><br />
  <em>When the war's over the Jews return</em><br />
  <em>Cheers and flowers adorn their way home</em><br />
  <em>&quot;We're not heroes or martyrs,&quot; so say the  Danes</em><br />
<em>&quot;We were just looking after our own&quot;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an  incredible story about the human spirit.   While many in other European countries occupied by the Nazis were all  too happy to see their Jewish countrymen carted off in cattlecars to their  certain death, the Danes risked their own lives to help rescue the Jews.  It’s not only a story of courage of the  Danes, but it’s also a story of how the Danes resisted the easy thing to do  (which would be to do nothing) and went the extra mile to do what was clearly  the right thing to do in saving their fellow countrymen.  Fred Small also deserves all the credit in  the world for writing and performing <strong>Denmark</strong><strong>, 1943</strong>.   I am still moved every time I hear it.</p>
