<h1 align="center">Willie Horton Ads</h1>

    <td width="1091" height="556"><p><a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1">The year was 1988.&nbsp; After 8 years of Reagan, his Vice President  George H.W. Bush had won the nomination but was 17 points behind in the polls  to Democrat Michael Dukakis.&nbsp; That was  until the Willie Horton attack ads began to air.&nbsp; </a>The first one read like this:<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
      Bush and Dukakis on crime.<br />
      Bush supports the death penalty for first degree murderers.<br />
      Dukakis not only opposed the death penalty, he allowed first  degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison<br />
      One was Willie Horton who murdered a boy in a robbery,  stabbing him 19 times<br />
      Despite a life sentence, Horton received 10 weekend passes  from prison<br />
      Horton fled, kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man, and  repeatedly raping his girlfriend<br />
      Weekend prison passes.&nbsp;  Dukakis on crime.</p>
      <p>A second ad, known as the revolving door ad, read like this:</p>
      <p>As governor Michael Dukakis vetoed mandatory sentences for  drug dealers.<br />
        He vetoed the death penalty.<br />
        His revolving door prison policy gave weekend furloughs to  first degree murderers not eligible for parole<br />
        While out, many committed other crimes like kidnapping and  rape, and many are still at large<br />
        Now Michael Dukakis wants to do for America what he&rsquo;s done  for Massachusetts<br />
        America can&rsquo;t afford that risk</p>
      <p>In both cases, the text of the ad does not do justice to the  impact these ads had.&nbsp; On the surface  reading the text, it looks like the Bush campaign had a disagreement with the  policy of allowing criminals to have weekend passes.&nbsp; They were trying to say &ldquo;we&rsquo;re tougher on  criminals&rdquo; etc. However, there&rsquo;s no way these ads could have erased a 17 point  lead in the polls based on a difference in prison policy.</p>
      <p>These ads cut right to the heart of the most racist fears  Americans have.&nbsp; The first ad showed  Willie Horton&rsquo;s angry, scowling face with the narrator saying the words  kidnapped, stabbing, and raping.&nbsp; Willie  Horton, of course, is a black man.&nbsp; The  second ad didn&rsquo;t mention Willie Horton by name, but cleverly shows a line of  prisoners walking out of prison, and the only prisoner that looks up at the  camera is a black man.&nbsp; Just like the  daisy girl ad in 1964, people had a visceral reaction as the ads were repeated  over and over by the news media giving them way more free air time than the  Bush campaign could ever have hoped for.&nbsp;  In 1964, the reaction was a vote for Goldwater meant we&rsquo;d be in a  nuclear war.&nbsp; In 1988, a vote for Dukakis  meant black killers and rapists would be running rampant on the streets of my  home town.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Although the Bush campaign denied responsibility for these  ads, it was clear campaign manager Lee Atwater was behind the Willie Horton  ads.&nbsp; Atwater had a reputation for dirty  politics and this was the dirtiest trick of all.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter that the ads were criticized  for the racism they brought out.&nbsp; People  reacted to it out of fear and it didn&rsquo;t matter who would make a better  president.&nbsp; Dukakis didn&rsquo;t do himself any  favors.&nbsp; As the ads were played over and  over, Dukakis tried to stay above the fray and ignored the ads until his 17  point lead had turned into a deficit.&nbsp;  Bush was elected rather easily.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>This type of dirty manipulative campaign ads have now become  the norm.&nbsp; The public hates negative ads.&nbsp; They deplore candidates twisting facts and  lying about their opponents.&nbsp; They  especially hate when one candidate uses a particularly emotional issue to twist  the facts and scar their opponent.&nbsp; But  it works.&nbsp; </p>
